      <p>
        Most of us have a favorite or two.
        <br />
        <br /> Some poetic line that lingers with us, that tugs on our
        heartstrings, and that we can call upon to lift us up when we need
        strength.
        <br />
        <br />
        This website is meant to provide a space where people can share
        and read some quotes to lift the human spirit.
